<h1>AwakenLife</h1>

My first public plugin released for minecraft

<a href="https://spigotmc.com">Spigot</a> <br>
<a href="https://discord.gg/uEzu8bdc">Discord</a>

This is a join of the famous Awaken and LifeSteal SMP combined!
If you get killed by a player, you will drop your head and you will be banned, like on the Awaken SMP. The only way to go back is to have another person to place down your head. Or a head of another person, renamed to your playername. Rename the item in an anvil, like normall.
However, if you die to a natural cause (a player's name is <strong>NOT</strong> in your death massage) you will lose 1 heart. The only way to get hearts back is to craft a heart and place it. If you loose all of your hearts, another player will have to place a heart revive stone, renamed to your playername.
